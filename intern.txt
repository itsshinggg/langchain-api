Internship Eligibility:
For international students, after completing the first three quarters, you can apply for the internship course with CPT as an elective course.
Students can take the internship course only if the school does not offer two core courses, and if they have not already taken two elective courses.
You need to obtain an offer letter and a program directorâ€™s approval letter by week 5 of the previous quarter.
You would not lose OPT time.
It is important to plan ahead and communicate with your advisor and program director.
